NATT_MSG				** Connected with NAT traversal - might be unstable **\r\n\r\nThis VPN Client is connected to the VPN Server '%S' by using the NAT Traversal (UDP Hole Punching) technology.\r\n\r\nNAT Traversal allows the VPN Server behind the NAT-box to accept VPN connections from VPN Client without any port-forwarding setting on the NAT-box.\r\n\r\nHowever, NAT Traversal-based VPN sessions sometimes become unstable, because NAT Traversal uses UDP-based protocol. For example, the VPN tunnel disconnects every 5 minutes if there is a poor NAT-box between the VPN Server and the VPN Client. Some large-scale NAT gateways in cheap ISPs sometimes cause the same problem on NAT Traversal. This is a problem of routers or ISPs. This is not a problem of SoftEther VPN software.\r\n\r\nTo solve the unstable tunnel problem, you should connect to the VPN Server's TCP listener port directly, instead of using NAT Traversal. To connect to the VPN Server directly by using TCP, a listener port of the VPN Server must be exposed to the Internet by a port-forward setting on the NAT-box.

# Virtual Hub Extended Options
HUB_AO_NoAddressPollingIPv4				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not perform the maintenance of the IPv4 address table and the MAC address table on the hub with using sending ARP packets per 5 seconds in order to check keep-alive IPv4 devices. As a result, IPv4 devices might be deleted on the IPv4 address table and MAC address table after a particular period (from 1 to 10 minutes) will be elapsed in the case of no-communication activities via the Virtual Hub, even if it is still alive. This option can eliminate the amount of broadcast packets, however some IPv4-related security policies will not work effectively.
HUB_AO_NoAddressPollingIPv6				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not perform the maintenance of the IPv6 address table and the MAC address table on the hub with using sending ICMPv6 packets per 5 seconds in order to check keep-alive IPv6 devices. As a result, IPv6 devices might be deleted on the IPv6 address table and MAC address table after a particular period (from 1 to 10 minutes) will be elapsed in the case of no-communication activities via the Virtual Hub, even if it is still alive. This option can eliminate the amount of broadcast packets, however some IPv6-related security policies will not work effectively.
HUB_AO_NoIpTable						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not construct and maintain the internal IP address table. This option can eliminate the amount of CPU and RAM usages, however some IP-related security policies will not work effectively.
HUB_AO_NoMacAddressLog					If you set this option to non-zero value, then any logs which indicate the registration of a new MAC address to the MAC address table on the Virtual Hub will not be logged to the security log.
HUB_AO_ManageOnlyPrivateIP				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the IPv4 address table of the Virtual Hub will contain only private IPv4 addresses. In this context, the private IPv4 addresses are: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 and 169.254.0.0/16. Any other IPv4 addresses will not added on the table.
HUB_AO_ManageOnlyLocalUnicastIPv6		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the IPv6 address table of the Virtual Hub will contain only local unicast IPv6 addresses. In this context, the private IPv6 addresses are: fe80::/10. Any other IPv6 addresses will not added on the table.
HUB_AO_DisableIPParsing					If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will disable the internal parsing function of IP headers in all Ethernet packets. This option can eliminate the amount of CPU and RAM usages, however the Vitual Hub will not perform building and maintenance of the IP address table internally, and some IP-related security policies will not work effectively.
HUB_AO_YieldAfterStorePacket			If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub sets the CPU to idle state after store-forward processing of a packet. This might results good effects to make the delay of packets shorter, however the counts of thread context switch will be increased and the performance might decline.
HUB_AO_FilterPPPoE						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) packets. It is convenient to split each site's PPPoE segment when making a bridge between two or more local area networks.
HUB_AO_FilterOSPF						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) packets.
HUB_AO_FilterIPv4						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all IPv4 and ARP packets.
HUB_AO_FilterIPv6						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all IPv6 packets.
HUB_AO_FilterNonIP						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all non-IP packets (non-IPv4, ARP or IPv6 packets). Incidentally, any tagged-VLAN packets via the Virtual Hub will be regarded as non-IP packets.
HUB_AO_FilterBPDU						If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub discards all BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) packets.
HUB_AO_NoIPv6DefaultRouterInRAWhenIPv6	If you set this option to non-zero value, then all VPN Sessions on the Virtual Hub will have the enabled "No Default-Router on IPv6 RA (physical IPv6)" security policy. When the physical communication protocol between VPN Client / VPN Bridge and VPN Server is IPv6, any IPv6 RA (Router Advertisement) packet with non-zero value in the router-lifetime will set to zero-value. This is effective to avoid the horrible behavior from the IPv6 routing confusion which is caused by the VPN client's attempts to use the remote-side IPv6 router as its local IPv6 router.
HUB_AO_NoLookBPDUBridgeId				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will ignore the source MAC field in a BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) packet. This value will be much more advanced. Do not modify it unless you are very ultra special expert of computer networking.
HUB_AO_NoManageVlanId					If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not use VLAN ID on the MAC address table. Any VLAN ID in tagged-VLAN packets will be ignored.
HUB_AO_VlanTypeId						Specify the Ethernet Type ID (TPID) of VLAN tags in decimal. The default value is 33024 (0x8100 in hex). This value will be much more advanced. Do not modify it unless you are very ultra special expert of computer networking.
HUB_AO_FixForDLinkBPDU					If you set this option to non-zero value, then the FixForDLinkBPDU option will be enabled. This value will be much more advanced. Do not modify it unless you are very ultra special expert of computer networking.
HUB_AO_NoIPv4PacketLog					If you set this option to non-zero value, then IPv4 packets via the Virtual Hub will not be logged.
HUB_AO_NoIPv6PacketLog					If you set this option to non-zero value, then IPv6 packets via the Virtual Hub will not be logged.
HUB_AO_NoSpinLockForPacketDelay			If you set this option to non-zero value, then the VPN Server will not use spin-lock mechanisms to simulate the delay of packets when the packet-delay generating function is applied to the packet. Instead, the timer interrupt by the operating system will be adopted. It will reduce the CPU time, however the resolution of generating delays will deteriorate.
HUB_AO_BroadcastStormDetectionThreshold	Specify the threshold to detect the broadcast storm per a second. When the number of broadcast packets from a particular VPN Session exceeded this threshold, packets will be regarded as broadcast storm and become subjects to be filtered. The default value (zero-value) is 32.
HUB_AO_ClientMinimumRequiredBuild		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will deny any access from VPN Client which has less build number than this value.
HUB_AO_RequiredClientId					If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will deny any access from VPN Client which doesn't have the embedded "Client ID" value in the software.
HUB_AO_AdjustTcpMssValue				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will adjust MSS (Max Segment Size) values of headers of all TCP/IP packets not to exceed this value.
HUB_AO_DisableAdjustTcpMss				If you set this option to non-zero value, then any MSS (Max Segment Size) options on the Virtual Hub will be disabled. Even if the AdjustTcpMssValue option is specified, or a VPN Session is made by IPsec / L2TP / EtherIP / L2TPv3 Server Function, the adjustment of MSS will be disabled.
HUB_AO_NoDhcpPacketLogOutsideHub		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not record non-related DHCP packets to the packet log. "Non-related DHCP packets" are DHCP packets which are not bound to any VPN Session on the Virtual Hub.
HUB_AO_DisableHttpParsing				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will not perform parsing HTTP headers in all HTTP packets. It will reduce the usage of CPU and RAM, however the HTTP access logs will not be recorded.
HUB_AO_DisableUdpAcceleration			If you set this option to non-zero value, then all UDP Acceleration Function will be disabled on the all VPN Sessions of the Virtual Hub.
HUB_AO_DisableUdpFilterForLocalBridgeNic	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub disables the trouble-preventing filtering function to filter DHCP packets which might causes of network unstable. By default, a local bridge interface sometimes try to acquire an IP address from remote-side DHCP server, however such a behavior should infinite loop in the routing table. The filtering function can avoid such problems. This option can disable the filtering function.
HUB_AO_ApplyIPv4AccessListOnArpPacket	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the IPv4 access list entries will be applied on not only IPv4 packets but also ARP packets. It is convenient to filter unnecessary ARP packets which might cause troubles.
HUB_AO_RemoveDefGwOnDhcpForLocalhost	If you set this option to non-zero value, when a VPN Client on the localhost connects to the Virtual Hub and try to acquire an IP address from the DHCP Server in the segment of the Virtual Hub, corresponding DHCP reply packets will be discarded. It can prevent unexpected infinite loop of packets routing.
HUB_AO_SecureNAT_MaxTcpSessionsPerIp	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the number of TCP connections (which is not SYN_SENT) per IP state will be limited to this value.
HUB_AO_SecureNAT_MaxTcpSynSentPerIp		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the number of TCP connections (which is SYN_SENT) per IP state will be limited to this value.
HUB_AO_SecureNAT_MaxUdpSessionsPerIp	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the number of UDP sessions per IP state will be limited to this value.
HUB_AO_SecureNAT_MaxDnsSessionsPerIp	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the number of DNS sessions per IP which is not SYN_SENT state will be limited to this value.
HUB_AO_SecureNAT_MaxIcmpSessionsPerIp	If you set this option to non-zero value, then the number of ICMP sessions per IP which is not SYN_SENT state will be limited to this value.
HUB_AO_AccessListIncludeFileCacheLifetime	Specify a period in seconds to hold the cache of external user-list files which is for an access list entry which has "include:" or "exclude:" formats as its username.
HUB_AO_DisableKernelModeSecureNAT		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Kernel-mode NAT function on the SecureNAT function will be disabled. Kernel-mode NAT is a function to accelerate the performance of the Virtual NAT function on SecureNAT. Kernel-mode NAT can work only when the VPN Server process is running with system privileges (i.e. root, SYSTEM or Administrators contexts.). If the Kernel-mode NAT causes something wrong operations, use this option to disable it.
HUB_AO_DisableUserModeSecureNAT				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the User-mode NAT function on the SecureNAT function will be disabled. User-mode NAT is a function to make the NAT possible to run as normal-user privileges.
HUB_AO_DisableCheckMacOnLocalBridge			If you set this option to non-zero value, the MAC address duplication check will be disabled on the Local Bridge function. There might be a case when some network adapters has a problem that reflects outgoing packets towards the Virtual Hub. A Virtual HUB detects such duplications automatically, and discards them. Enable this flag to disable the detection and discarding.
HUB_AO_DisableCorrectIpOffloadChecksum		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the checking and correction of IP check-sum value on the Local Bridge function. Some network adapters, which have IP, TCP or UDP header check-sum offloading engines, transmit packets with incomplete check-sum values. Such packets cannot be treated correctly by receiver-side. So the Local Bridge detects such packets and corrects its check-sum fields. Enable this flag to disable such correction.
HUB_AO_BroadcastLimiterStrictMode			If you set this option to non-zero value, then the broadcast-storm detection algorithm will compare either source or destination IP address of each packet. If any of the two fields matches, the packet will be recorded on the short-term history of broadcast-storm detection state machine.
HUB_AO_MaxLoggedPacketsPerMinute			Maximum number of logging target packets per minute.
HUB_AO_DoNotSaveHeavySecurityLogs			Do not take heavy security log.
HUB_AO_DropBroadcastsInPrivacyFilterMode	Drop broadcasting packets if the both source and destination session is PrivacyFilter mode.
HUB_AO_DropArpInPrivacyFilterMode			Drop ARP packets if the both source and destination session is PrivacyFilter mode.
HUB_AO_SuppressClientUpdateNotification		Suppress the update notification screen on the VPN Client.
HUB_AO_FloodingSendQueueBufferQuota			Specify the quota limitation value (in bytes) of the sending queue buffer size which the flooding operation on the Virtual Hub can consume. The quota value is applied on the total length of sending queues of all active VPN sessions. Specify '0' to disable the quota. This option is effective to solve the out-of-memory problem on the network where there are many flooding packets.
HUB_AO_AssignVLanIdByRadiusAttribute		Enable the VLAN ID dynamic assignment function. Each VPN session will be assigned its own VLAN ID by the RADIUS attribute value when the user is authenticated by the external RADIUS server unless the user object has a VLAN ID security policy. The RADIUS attribute with the name "Tunnel-Pvt-Group-ID" (ID = 81) will be used as the VLAN ID. The data type must be STRING.
HUB_AO_DenyAllRadiusLoginWithNoVlanAssign	If you set this option to non-zero value, then all users, which RADIUS server returns no "Tunnel-Pvt-Group-ID" (ID = 81) value, will be denied to connect to the Virtual Hub. (Only if the values of AssignVLanIdByRadiusAttribute is non-zero value.)

HUB_AO_DetectDormantSessionInterval			If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub will treat the VPN sessions, which have transmitted no packets for the last specified intervals (in seconds), as Dormant Sessions. The Virtual Hub will not flood packets, which should be flood, to any Dormant Sessions.
HUB_AO_NoPhysicalIPOnPacketLog				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the physical IP addresses of VPN clients of either the source VPN session or the destination VPN session will not be recorded on the packet log file.
HUB_AO_UseHubNameAsDhcpUserClassOption		If you set this option to non-zero value, then the Virtual Hub Name will be added to a DHCP request to an external DHCP server as the "User-Class" option. This allows to use separate pools of IP addresses for each Virtual Hub. (For only L2TP/IPsec and OpenVPN sessions.)
HUB_AO_UseHubNameAsRadiusNasId				If you set this option to non-zero value, then the NAS-Identidier RADIUS attribute will be set to a name of the Virtual Hub. This allows to determine on RADIUS server whether access to the Virtual Hub should be granted or denied.

POL_37					VLAN ID (IEEE802.1Q)
POL_EX_37				You can specify the VLAN ID on the security policy. All VPN Sessions defines this policy, all Ethernet packets toward the Virtual Hub from the user will be inserted a VLAN tag (IEEE 802.1Q) with the VLAN ID. The user can also receive only packets with a VLAN tag which has the same VLAN ID. (Receiving process removes the VLAN tag automatically.) Any Ethernet packets with any other VLAN IDs or non-VLAN packets will not be received. All VPN Sessions without this policy definition can send / receive any kinds of Ethernet packets regardless of VLAN tags, and VLAN tags are not inserted or removed automatically. Any tagged-VLAN packets via the Virtual Hub will be regarded as non-IP packets. Therefore, tagged-VLAN packets are not subjects for IPv4 / IPv6 security policies, access lists nor other IPv4 / IPv6 specific deep processing.

In this case, the messages regarding progress status, error messages and other messages displayed by VPN Client will be displayed on a session called the "Console Session".
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_LOCAL_21	Currently "Session ID: 0, User %s" is assigned as the Console Session of this computer, however because you have started VPN Client Manager on session %u, it is not possible to display the message windows such as the progress status or errors that VPN Client displays.
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_LOCAL_22	Currently no one is logged into the Console Session "Session ID: 0" of this computer and because you have started VPN Client Manager on session %u, it is not possible to display the message windows such as the progress status or errors that VPN Client displays.
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_LOCAL_31	It is recommended that when this computer's Console Session (Session ID: 0, User %s) is displayed, start the VPN Client Manager in that session and start the connection to the VPN Connection Setting "%s". You will be able to start a connection process by doing what you are doing now. But it will be at the risk of being unable to check the progress status and error messages that may be displayed during the process.
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_LOCAL_32	It is recommended that you first log off and then after logging in locally, start the VPN Client Manager in that session and start the connection to VPN Connection Setting "%s". Although you will be able to start a connection process by doing what you are doing now, this will be at the risk of being unable to check the progress status and error messages that may be displayed during the process.
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_REMOTE_1	Because you are currently performing operation while remotely connected to VPN Client on computer %S, if the VPN Client displays any progress status or error messages during the VPN connection process to the VPN Connection Setting, you will not be able to check these messages from your current screen display.
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_REMOTE_2	To check all the progress status, error and other message windows that VPN Client displays, you must log in locally to computer %S and display the Control Session (desktop). 
CM_DESKTOP_MSG_REMOTE_3	It is recommended that you first log in directly and locally to computer %S, and then start the VPN Client Manager in that session and start the connection to VPN Connection Setting "%s". Although you will be able to start a connection process by doing what you are doing now, this will be at the risk of being unable to check the progress status and error messages that may be displayed during the process.
CM_STOP_INST_VLAN_1		To install a Virtual Network Adapter on this computer you must start the VPN Client Manager within a "Console Session". \r\n\r\nCurrently, %s is installed on this computer and the current user is not logged into the Console Session but rather is logged in as the remote session (session ID: %u).\r\nTo install a Virtual Network Adapter, VPN Client Manager must be started in the Console Session (session ID: %u, user %s is logged on). \r\n\r\nFirst log on to the computer locally by using the user switching function, or the /console switch function that is on the remote desktop, or alternatively the computer's local console device and then start the VPN Client Manager and install the Virtual Network Adapter.
CM_STOP_INST_VLAN_2		To install a Virtual Network Adapter on this computer you must start the VPN Client Manager within a "Console Session". \r\n\r\nCurrently, %s is installed on this computer and the current user is not logged into the Console Session but rather is logged in as the remote session (session ID: %u).\r\nTo install a Virtual Network Adapter you must start the VPN Client Manager within a "Console Session". \r\n(Currently the user is not logged on to the Console Session (Session ID: 0).) \r\n\r\nFirst log on to the computer locally by using the user switching function, or the /console switch function that is on the remote desktop, or alternatively the computer's local console device and then start the VPN Client Manager and install the Virtual Network Adapter.
CM_SHORTCUT_DESKTOP_MSG	To start a connection using the shortcut to the VPN Connection Setting, you must launch the shortcut file within the "Console Session". \r\n\r\nCurrently the user is logged on as the remote session (session ID: %u) and not as the Console Session.
CM_HTTP_PROXY_WARNING	Connect via HTTP Proxy Server is selected. \r\n\r\nIn many cases, the HTTP proxy server will only allow 2 kinds of TCP port to be used for the connection to the destination server port number, HTTP protocol (TCP port number 80) and HTTPS protocol (TCP port number 443). \r\n(There are also cases when the proxy server does allow a wider choice of TCP port for connection.) \r\n\r\nWhen making a VPN connection via an HTTP proxy server that denies connections to server ports other than HTTP ports or HTTPS ports, you must specify 443 (HTTPS protocol) as the destination VPN Server port number. \r\n\r\nTo check whether the HTTP proxy server you are connecting via allows connection to ports other than port numbers 80 or 443, contact the administrator of the HTTP proxy server. \r\n\r\nCurrently, %d is specified as the destination VPN Server port number. Do you want to change the port number to 443 (HTTPS protocol)?\r\n(The port 443 of the VPN Servers you connect to must be set to listening status and ready for connection.) \r\nIf you are unsure, then contact the system administrator or the network administrator.

SM_BRIDGE_WPCAP_REMOTE	In order to use the Local Bridge function on this VPN Server, you must install the WinPcap software. The software WinPcap is currently not installed on the server computer. \r\n\r\nTo continue the installation of the WinPcap software, you must start SoftEther VPN Server Manager on the server computer that is running VPN Server and then while connected to localhost (location of your own computer), have the Local Bridge Function Setting window displayed. \r\nTo continue, first exit this management session, and then, after starting SoftEther VPN Server Manager on the server computer, connect to localhost and continue the setting process. 
SM_BRIDGE_WPCAP_ROOT	In order to use the Local Bridge function on this VPN Server, you must install the WinPcap software. \r\n\r\nTo continue the installation you must log in to this computer as a user with administrator privileges. \r\nLog on as an administrator and start the SoftEther VPN Server Manager again.
SM_BRIDGE_WPCAP_INSTALL	In order to use the Local Bridge function on this VPN Server, you must install the WinPcap software. The software WinPcap is currently not installed on the server computer. \r\n\r\nWinPcap is an easy-to-install free software that is bundled together with the VPN Server. \r\n\r\nDo you want to begin the installation of WinPcap?
SM_BRIDGE_WPCAP_REBOOT1	After WinPcap installation has completed, you must restart the computer before you use the Local Bridge function again. \r\n\r\nAfter you restart the computer manually and start VPN Server, configure the settings for the Local Bridge function.
SM_BRIDGE_WPCAP_REBOOT2	After WinPcap installation has completed, you must restart the SoftEther VPN Server service before you use the Local Bridge function again. \r\n\r\nIt only takes a short time to restart the SoftEther VPN Server service, however all sessions that are currently connected to the VPN Server will be disconnected. \r\nThis management session will also be disconnected, so you will need to reconnect to continue. \r\n\r\nDo you want to restart the SoftEther VPN Server service?

SM_BRIDGE_INTEL			While in the condition that occurs immediately after a new bridge connection is made when bridging to a physical network adapter, depending on the type of network adapter, there are cases where it will not be possible to communicate using TCP/IP to the network adapter using a bridge connection from a computer on the virtual network. \r\n(This phenomenon is known to occur for Intel and Broadcom network adapters.) \r\n\r\n\r\nIf this issue arises, remedy the situation by restarting the computer on which VPN Server / Bridge is running. Normal communication will be possible after the computer has restarted. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso many wireless network adapters will not respond to the sending of packets in promiscuous mode and when this occurs you will be unable to use the Local Bridge. If this issue arises, try using a regular wired network adapter instead of the wireless network adapter.
SM_BRIDGE_VPN			You are attempting to make a Local Bridge to "%S".\r\n\r\nA Local Bridge is made between a Virtual Hub and a physical network adapter in usual usage.

SM_VLAN_MSG_1			The Windows Registry has been configured to allow the network adapter "%S" to transmit / receive tagged-VLAN packets.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some network adapters which requires additional settings on the property of the Device Manager on the local computer's Windows to set the parameters to enable Jumbo Frames. (Ethernet frames which are larger than 1,512 bytes.) Unless you enable Jumbo Frames, some large VLAN packets will be dropped. In the case if large VLAN packets always disappeared, please enable Jumbo Frames. (For example, set the maximum size to 4,088 bytes.) The Device Manager in Windows will help you to configure.\r\n\r\nThis VLAN Transparency Setting has been written to the Windows Registry, however it is not guaranteed that VLAN packets can be transmitted effectively.\r\nIf transmitting VLAN tagged packets will fail after this configuration, refer the manual of the network adapter "%S" to configure manually and adequately. Moreover, "%S" might not support the VLAN transparency setting. In that case, such a network adapter cannot be used to transmit VLAN frames. Use other products.\r\n\r\nTo apply this setting, Windows which runs VPN Server must be rebooted. Do not forget to reboot it.

The binary data is the result of SHA-1 hash function to the temporary string. The temporary string is the combination of the bit-array of the above fields plus the secret string after the '|' symbol in the redirection URL. (In the above example, "secret" is the secret string.) If there are no '|' symbols in the URL, no hash value will be appended.\r\n\r\nThe Purpose of Hash Value: The secret string is effective as the secret key. Thanks to the secret key, the CGI program which receives the query strings on the redirected URL can verify the integrity of the parameters included in the URL.\r\n

S1						The VPN Gate Academic Experiment Service is operated as a research project at the graduate school on University of Tsukuba, Japan. The service is governed under the Japanese laws. Other countries' laws are none of our concerns nor responsibilities.
S2						By nature, there are almost 200 countries in the World, with different laws. It is impossible to verify every countries' laws and regulations and make the software comply with all countries' laws in advance to release the software. If a user uses VPN Gate service in a specific country, and damaged by public servants of the authority, the developer of either the service or software will never be liable to recover or compensate such damages or criminal responsibilities.
S3						By using this software and service, the user must observe all concerned laws and rules with user's own responsibility. The user will be completely liable to any damages and responsibilities which are results of using this software and service, regardless of either inside or outside of Japan's territory.
S4						If you don't agree nor understand the above warnings, do not use any of VPN Gate Academic Experiment Service functions.
S5						Note: VPN Gate is a research project for just academic purpose only. VPN Gate was developed as a plug-in for SoftEther VPN and UT-VPN. However, all parts of VPN Gate were developed on this research project at University of Tsukuba. Any parts of VPN Gate are not developed by SoftEther VPN Project.

S1						This Virtual DHCP Server can push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) with DHCP reply messages to VPN clients.
S2						Whether or not a VPN client can recognize the classless static routes (RFC 3442) depends on the target VPN client software. SoftEther VPN Client and OpenVPN Client are supporting the classless static routes. On L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP protocols, the compatibility depends on the implementation of the client software.
S3						You can realize the split tunneling if you clear the default gateway field on the Virtual DHCP Server options. On the client side, L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP clients need to be configured not to set up the default gateway for the split tunneling usage.
S4						You can also push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) by your existing external DHCP server. In that case, disable the Virtual DHCP Server function on SecureNAT, and you need not to set up the classless routes on this screen.
S5						Edit the static routing table to push
S6						Example: 192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.254, 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0/192.168.4.253\r\n\r\nSplit multiple entries (maximum: 64 entries) by comma or space characters.\r\nEach entry must be specified in the "IP network address/subnet mask/gateway IP address" format.

# VPNCMD コマンド
CMD_VPNCMD				SoftEther VPN Command Line Management Utility
CMD_VPNCMD_HELP			The 'vpncmd' program is a utility that allows you to manage SoftEther VPN software by using command lines. By using vpncmd, you can connect to a VPN Client, a VPN Server or VPN Bridge that is running on a local or remote computer and manage these services. Moreover, by using VPN Tools mode, you can call the Network Traffic Speed Test Tool and the certificate creation function. These can be used even when not connected to the VPN Server or VPN Client. \nWhen using vpncmd, if the file name is specified by using the /IN and /OUT parameter, the command can be executed in a batch according to a file in which the executable commands are enumerated and the execution results can be written to a file. Normally a command prompt will appear after vpncmd is launched but when an input file is specified by the /IN parameter, the program will automatically terminate after the execution of all lines in the input file is complete. Also, when a command to execute is specified by the /CMD parameter, the program will automatically terminate after the execution of that command is complete. You cannot specify the /IN parameter and the /CMD parameter at the same time. The termination code of the vpncmd program will be the error code of the last executed command (0 in the case of successful execution). \nUnder a Windows environment, when vpncmd is launched once or more by a user with administrator privileges, it is possible to simply input 'vpncmd' to a Windows command prompt or [Run...] window to launch vpncmd. To achieve the same result under a UNIX system, you can manually set, as appropriate, the PATH environment variable.
CMD_VPNCMD_ARGS			vpncmd [host:port] [/CLIENT|/SERVER|/TOOLS] [/HUB:hub] [/ADMINHUB:adminhub] [/PASSWORD:password] [/IN:infile] [/OUT:outfile] [/CMD commands...]
CMD_VPNCMD_[host:port]	By specifying parameters in the format "host name:port number", a connection will automatically be made to that host. If this is not specified, a prompt will appear to input the connection destination. When connecting to a VPN Client, you cannot specify a port number.
CMD_VPNCMD_CLIENT		This will connect to VPN Client to do management. You cannot specify it together with /SERVER.
CMD_VPNCMD_SERVER		This will connect to VPN Server or VPN Bridge to do management. You cannot specify it together with /CLIENT.
CMD_VPNCMD_TOOLS		This will enables use of VPN Tools commands. VPN Tools include the simple certificate creation tool (MakeCert command) and the Network Traffic Speed Test Tool (SpeedTest command).
CMD_VPNCMD_HUB			When connecting to the VPN Server by "Virtual Hub Admin Mode", this specifies the Virtual Hub name 'hub'. If you specify the host name but not the /HUB parameter, connection will be by "Server Admin Mode".
CMD_VPNCMD_ADMINHUB		This will specify the name of the Virtual Hub 'adminhub' that is automatically selected after connecting to the VPN Server. If the /HUB parameter was specified, the Virtual Hub will be selected automatically and this specification will not be necessary.
CMD_VPNCMD_PASSWORD		If the administrator password is required when connecting, specify the password 'password'. When the password is not specified, a prompt to input the password will be displayed.
CMD_VPNCMD_IN			This will specify the text file 'infile' that contains the list of commands that are automatically executed after the connection is completed. If the /IN parameter is specified, the vpncmd program will terminate automatically after the execution of all commands in the file are finished. If the file contains multiple-byte characters, the encoding must be Unicode (UTF-8). This cannot be specified together with /CMD (if /CMD is specified, /IN will be ignored).
CMD_VPNCMD_OUT			You can specify the text file 'outfile' to write all strings such as onscreen prompts, message, error and execution results. Note that if the specified file already exists, the contents of the existing file will be overwritten. Output strings will be recorded using Unicode (UTF-8) encoding.
CMD_VPNCMD_CMD			If the optional command 'commands...' is included after /CMD, that command will be executed after the connection is complete and the vpncmd program will terminate after that. This cannot be specified together with /IN (if specified together with /IN, /IN will be ignored). Specify the /CMD parameter after all other vpncmd parameters.
CMD_VPNCMD_CSV			You can specify this option to enable CSV outputs. Results of each command will be printed in the CSV format. It is useful for processing the results by other programs.
CMD_VPNCMD_CS_1			By using vpncmd program, the following can be achieved. \n\n1. Management of VPN Server or VPN Bridge \n2. Management of VPN Client\n3. Use of VPN Tools (certificate creation and Network Traffic Speed Test Tool)\n\n

Each entry must be specified in the "IP network address/subnet mask/gateway IP address" format.\nThis Virtual DHCP Server can push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) with DHCP reply messages to VPN clients.\nWhether or not a VPN client can recognize the classless static routes (RFC 3442) depends on the target VPN client software. SoftEther VPN Client and OpenVPN Client are supporting the classless static routes. On L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP protocols, the compatibility depends on the implementation of the client software. You can realize the split tunneling if you clear the default gateway field on the Virtual DHCP Server options. On the client side, L2TP/IPsec and MS-SSTP clients need to be configured not to set up the default gateway for the split tunneling usage.\nYou can also push the classless static routes (RFC 3442) by your existing external DHCP server. In that case, disable the Virtual DHCP Server function on SecureNAT, and you need not to set up the classless routes on this command.\nSee the RFC 3442 to understand the classless routes.

# MakeCert command
CMD_MakeCert			Create New X.509 Certificate and Private Key (1024 bit)
CMD_MakeCert_Help		Use this to create a new X.509 certificate and private key and save it as a file. \nThe algorithm used to create the public key and private key of the certificate is RSA 1024 bit. \nYou can choose to create a root certificate (self-signed certificate) or a certificate signed by another certificate. To create a certificate that is signed by another certificate, you require a private key file (base 64 encoded) that is compatible with the certificate that uses the signature (X.509 format file). \n\nWhen creating a certificate, you can specify the following: Name (CN), Organization (O), Organization Unit (OU), Country (C), State (ST), Locale (L), Serial Number, and Expiration Date. \nThe created certificate will be saved as an X.509 format file and the private key file will be saved in a Base 64 encoded RSA 1024 bit format file. \n\nThe MakeCert command is a tool that provides the most rudimentary function for creating certificates. If you want to create a more substantial certificate, we recommend that you use either free software such as OpenSSL, or commercial CA (certificate authority) software. \n\nNote: This command can be called from the SoftEther VPN Command Line Management Utility. You can also execute this command while connected to the current VPN Server or VPN Client in Administration Mode but, what actually performs the RSA computation, generates the certificate data and saves it to file is the computer on which the command is running, and all this is executed in a context that has absolutely no relationship to the computer that is the destination of the Administration Mode connection.

# TrafficClient command
CMD_TrafficClient		Run Network Traffic Speed Test Tool in Client Mode
CMD_TrafficClient_Help	Use this to execute the communication throughput measurement tool's client program. \nTwo commands, TrafficClient and TrafficServer, are used for the communication throughput measurement tool to enable the measurement of communication throughput that can be transferred between two computers connected by IP network. The TrafficServer command is used first on another computer which puts the communication throughput measurement tool server in a listening condition. Then the TrafficClient command is used to connect to that server by specifying its host name or IP address and port number, which makes it possible to measure the communication speed. \nMeasurement of the communication speed is carried out by concurrently establishing multiple TCP connections and calculating the actual number of bits of data that can be transferred within a specified time based on the respective results of transferring the maximum stream data on each connection and then using that to calculate the average value (bps) of communication throughput. Normally when there is one TCP connection, it is common to only be able to achieve communication speeds slower than the actual net throughput because of limitations related to the TCP algorithm. We therefore recommend the establishment of multiple concurrent TCP connections when measuring communication results. Because the throughput that is measured using this measurement method is calculated from the bit length of the data that arrives on the receiver side as a stream by TCP, the packet loss that occurs during transfer and the packets with corrupted data are not included in the packets that actually arrive, which means it is possible to calculate a genuine value that is close to the maximum possible communication bandwidth of the network. \nUsing the measurement results, i.e. the stream size transferred by TCP, the approximate value of data volume that actually passed through the network is calculated and this is divided by time to calculate the bits per sec (bps). The calculation assumes the type of the physical network is Ethernet (IEEE802.3) and the MAC frame payload size is 1,500 bytes (TCP MSS is 1,460 bytes). By specifying the /RAW option, the calculation will not make corrections for the TCP/IP header and MAC header data volume. \n\nNote: This command can be called from the SoftEther VPN Command Line Management Utility. You can also execute this command while connected to the current VPN Server or VPN Client in Administration Mode but, what actually conducts communication and measures the throughput is the computer on which the command is running, and all this is executed in a context that has absolutely no relationship to the computer that is the destination of the Administration Mode connection.
CMD_TrafficClient_Args	TrafficClient [host:port] [/NUMTCP:numtcp] [/TYPE:download|upload|full] [/SPAN:span] [/DOUBLE:yes|no] [/RAW:yes|no]
CMD_TrafficClient_[host:port]	Specify the host name or IP address and port number that the communication throughput measurement tool server (TrafficServer) is listening for. If the port number is omitted, 9821 will be used.
CMD_TrafficClient_NUMTCP	Specify the number of TCP connections to be concurrently established between the client and the server for data transfer. If omitted, 32 will be used.
CMD_TrafficClient_TYPE		Specify the direction of data flow when throughput measurement is performed. Specify one of the following options: "download", "upload" or "full". By specifying "download" the data will be transmitted from the server side to the client side. By specifying "upload" the data will be transmitted from the client side to the server side. By specifying "full", the data will be transferred in both directions. When "full" is specified, the NUMTCP value must be an even number of two or more (half the number will be used for concurrent TCP connections in the download direction and the other half will be used in the upload direction). If this parameter is omitted, "full" will be used.
CMD_TrafficClient_SPAN		Specify, using seconds, the time span to conduct data transfer for the measurement of throughput. If this parameter is omitted, "15" will be used.
CMD_TrafficClient_DOUBLE	When "yes" is specified, the throughput of the measured result will be doubled and then displayed. This option is used for cases when a network device etc. is somewhere on the data route and the total throughput capability that is input and output by this network device is being measured.
CMD_TrafficClient_RAW		By specifying "yes", the calculation will not make corrections for the TCP/IP header and MAC header data volume.
CMD_TrafficClient_EVAL_NUMTCP	Specify a value of 32 or less for the number of TCP connections.
CMD_TrafficClient_PROMPT_HOST	Measurement Server Name and Port Number (9821 if omitted): 
CMD_TrafficClient_ERROR_NUMTCP	When the data direction is "full" (both directions), you must specify an even value for the number of TCP connections (/NUMTCP).
CMD_TrafficClient_ERROR_HOSTPORT	The host name or port number is incorrectly specified.


# TrafficServer command
CMD_TrafficServer		Run Network Traffic Speed Test Tool in Server Mode
CMD_TrafficServer_Help	Use this to execute the communication throughput measurement tool's server program. \nTwo commands, TrafficClient and TrafficServer, are used for the communication throughput measurement tool to enable the measurement of communication throughput that can be transferred between two computers connected by IP network. \nTo set the TCP port of this computer to the Listen status to listen for the connection from the TrafficClient of another computer, specify the port number and start the server program using the TrafficServer command. \nYou can display more detailed information on the communication throughput measurement tool by inputting "TrafficClient ?". \n\nNote: This command can be called from the SoftEther VPN Command Line Management Utility. You can also execute this command while connected to the current VPN Server or VPN Client in Administration Mode but, what actually conducts communication and measures the throughput is the computer on which the command is running, and all this is executed in a context that has absolutely no relationship to the computer that is the destination of the Administration Mode connection.
CMD_TrafficServer_Args	TrafficServer [port] [/NOHUP:yes|no]
CMD_TrafficServer_[port]	Specify, using an integer, the port number at which to listen for the connection. If the specified port has been already being used by another program, or if the port cannot be opened, an error will occur.
CMD_TrafficServer_NOHUP		When "yes" is specified, the server process never stops without regard to any input from the console. It is convenient when you want to run the TrafficServer endlessly.
