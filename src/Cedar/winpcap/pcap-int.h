/*!
	There is really a mess with previous variables, and it seems to me that they are not used
	(they are used in pcap_pf.c only). I think we have to start using them.
	The meaning is the following:

	- TotPkts: the amount of packets received by the bpf filter, *before* applying the filter
	- TotAccepted: the amount of packets that satisfies the filter
	- TotDrops: the amount of packet that were dropped into the kernel buffer because of lack of space
	- TotMissed: the amount of packets that were dropped by the physical interface; it is basically 
	the value of the hardware counter into the card. This number is never put to zero, so this number
	takes into account the *total* number of interface drops starting from the interface power-on.
	- OrigMissed: the amount of packets that were dropped by the interface *when the capture begins*.
	This value is used to detect the number of packets dropped by the interface *during the present
	capture*, so that (ps_ifdrops= TotMissed - OrigMissed).
*/

/*!
	\brief It keeps the number of packets that have been received by the application.
	
	Packets dropped by the kernel buffer are not counted in this variable. The variable is always 
	equal to (TotAccepted - TotDrops), exept for the case of remote capture, in which we have also
	packets in fligh, i.e. that have been transmitted by the remote host, but that have not been 
	received (yet) from the client. In this case, (TotAccepted - TotDrops - TotNetDrops) gives a
	wrong result, since this number does not corresponds always to the number of packet received by 
	the application. For this reason, in the remote capture we need another variable that takes
	into account of the number of packets actually received by the application.
