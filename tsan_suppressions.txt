# This file contains suppressions for Thread Sanitizer.
# For the specification, refer to: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/threadsanitizersuppressions


# Thread Sanitizer reports data races on Finished and NoDelayFlag in CONNECT_SERIAL_PARAM,
# shared between BindConnectThreadForIPv4, BindConnectThreadForIPv6, and BindConnectEx5.
# These are benign data races: the Set/Wait on FinishEvent provides synchronization
# equivalent to a lock, but TSan cannot recognize it.
