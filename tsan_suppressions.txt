## Set/Wait
# This provides synchronization equivalent to a lock, but Thread Sanitizer cannot recognize it.

# Thread Sanitizer reports data race on Halt in TK64.

# Thread Sanitizer reports data races on Finished and NoDelayFlag in CONNECT_SERIAL_PARAM,
# shared between BindConnectThreadForIPv4, BindConnectThreadForIPv6, and BindConnectEx5.

## Manual PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
# The Lock/Unlock mechanism on Unix is a manual, hand-coded implementation of PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
# We avoid using the PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE directly because it exhibits critical bugs, such as deadlocks
# on certain older systems(Linux, Solaris, or macOS). While Thread Sanitizer will report data races,
# these warnings should be ignored as the logic has been carefully implemented to ensure thread safety.
