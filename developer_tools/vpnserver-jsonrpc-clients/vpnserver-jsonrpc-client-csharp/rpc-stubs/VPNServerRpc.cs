Also, if your ISP assignes you a dynamic (not-fixed) IP address, the corresponding IP address of your Dynamic DNS hostname will be automatically changed. It enables you to keep running the VPN Server by using only a dynamic IP address. Therefore, you need not any longer to keep static global IP addresses with expenses monthly costs. [Caution] To disable the Dynamic DNS Function, modify the configuration file of VPN Server. The "declare root" directive has the "declare DDnsClient" directive. In this directive, you can switch "bool Disable" from false to true, and reboot the VPN Server, then the Dynamic DNS Function will be disabled. To call this API, you must have VPN Server administrator privileges. This API cannot be invoked on VPN Bridge.
