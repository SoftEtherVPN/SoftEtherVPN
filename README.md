# SOFTETHER VPN ADVANTAGES


- Supporting all popular VPN protocols by the single VPN server:
  SSL-VPN (HTTPS)
  OpenVPN
  IPsec
  L2TP
  MS-SSTP
  L2TPv3
  EtherIP
- Free and open-source software.
- Easy to establish both remote-access and site-to-site VPN.
- SSL-VPN Tunneling on HTTPS to pass through NATs and firewalls.
- Revolutionary VPN over ICMP and VPN over DNS features.
- Resistance to highly-restricted firewall.
- Ethernet-bridging (L2) and IP-routing (L3) over VPN.
- Embedded dynamic-DNS and NAT-traversal so that no static nor
  fixed IP address is required.
- AES 256-bit and RSA 4096-bit encryptions.
- Sufficient security features such as logging and firewall inner
  VPN tunnel.
- User authentication with RADIUS and NT domain controllers.
- User authentication with X.509 client certificate.
- Packet logging.
- 1Gbps-class high-speed throughput performance with low memory and
  CPU usage.
- Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone are
  supported.
- The OpenVPN clone function supports legacy OpenVPN clients.
- IPv4 / IPv6 dual-stack.
- The VPN server runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X.
- Configure All settings on GUI.
- Multi-languages (English, Japanese and Simplified-Chinese).
- No memory leaks. High quality stable codes, intended for long-term runs.
  We always verify that there are no memory or resource leaks before
  releasing the build.

[RTM version](https://www.freshports.org/security/softether/) are available on FreeBSD.

## From binary installers:

Those can be found under https://www.softether-download.com/
There you can also find SoftEtherVPN source code in zip and tar formats.

## Build from Source code

see [BUILD_UNIX](src/BUILD_UNIX.md) or [BUILD_WINDOWS](src/BUILD_WINDOWS.md)

There are two flavours of SoftEtherVPN source code:

1. Unstable. Found under https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN
2. Stable. Found under https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable


# About HTML5-based Modern Admin Console and JSON-RPC API Suite

## Built-in SoftEther VPN Server HTML5 Ajax-based Web Administration Console
We are developing the HTML5 Ajax-based Web Administration Console (currently very limited, under construction) in the embedded HTTPS server on the SoftEther VPN Server.

Access to the following URL from your favorite web browser.

```
https://<vpn_server_hostname>:<port>/admin/
```

For example if your VPN Server is running as the port 5555 on the host at 192.168.0.1, you can access to the web console by:

```
https://192.168.0.1:5555/admin/
```

Note: Your HTML5 development contribution is very appreciated. The current HTML5 pages are written by Daiyuu Nobori (the core developer of SoftEther VPN). He is obviously lack of HTML5 development ability. Please kindly consider to contribute for SoftEther VPN's development on GitHub. Your code will help every people running SoftEther VPN Server.


## Built-in SoftEther Server VPN JSON-RPC API Suite
The API Suite allows you to easily develop your original SoftEther VPN Server management application to control the VPN Server (e.g. creating users, adding Virtual Hubs, disconnecting a specified VPN sessions).

You can access to the [latest SoftEther VPN Server JSON-RPC Document on GitHub.](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/tree/master/developer_tools/vpnserver-jsonrpc-clients/)

- Almost all control APIs, which the VPN Server provides, are available as JSON-RPC API.
You can write your own VPN Server management application in your favorite languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, ... etc.)
- If you are planning to develop your own VPN cloud service, the JSON-RPC API is the best choice to realize the automated operations for the VPN Server.
- No need to use any specific API client library since all APIs are provided on the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification. You can use your favorite JSON and HTTPS client library to call any of all APIs in your pure runtime environment.
- Also, the SoftEther VPN Project provides high-quality JSON-RPC client stub libraries which define all of the API client stub codes. These libraries are written in C#, JavaScript and TypeScript. The Node.js Client Library for VPN Server RPC (vpnrpc) package is also available.


# TO CIRCUMVENT YOUR GOVERNMENT'S FIREWALL RESTRICTION

Because SoftEther VPN is overly strong tool to build a VPN tunnel,
some censorship governments want to block your access to the source code
of SoftEther VPN, by abusing their censorship firewalls.

To circumvent your censor's unjust restriction,
SoftEther VPN Project distributes the up-to-date source-code
on all the following open-source repositories:

  - GitHub
    https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git
```

  - GitLab (mirrored from GitHub)
    https://gitlab.com/SoftEther/SoftEtherVPN/

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/SoftEther/SoftEtherVPN.git
```

We hope that you can reach one of the above URLs at least!
